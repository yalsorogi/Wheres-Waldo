# Wheres-Waldo

This is a Python code game I made that inpsired by  the "Where's Waldo?" guessing game. The program begins by displaying a list of countries and randomly selecting a secret location from this list using a random number generator. The user is then prompted to guess the location. A while loop is employed to repeatedly check the user's guess against the secret location, providing feedback if the guess is incorrect. The loop continues until the user correctly identifies the secret location, at which point a success message is displayed, revealing where "Waldo" was hiding.
